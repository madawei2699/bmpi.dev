## About Me

By title, a developer. In my mind, a systems architect. But at my core, I am a trader.

## My Infinite Game

I believe in connecting with ropes, not conquering with sticks.

Therefore, everything I create serves a single purpose: to become a connective system — linking reason and human nature, ideas and execution, investors and markets.

Its foundation is writing. Its bridge is products. Its horizon is a gamified, immersive world.
